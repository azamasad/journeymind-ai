# JourneyMind AI

> **Proactive AI Travel Disruption Assistant**

JourneyMind AI is a hackathon-ready enterprise demo that acts as an AI copilot for the entire travel journey. It proactively detects flight disruptions, evaluates alternatives, updates itineraries, recommends airport services, predicts impact, and answers traveler questions — all in real time.

---

## Overview

When a flight is delayed, cancelled, or a gate changes, JourneyMind AI does not wait for the traveler to search for help. It:

- Detects disruptions from mock flight data
- Evaluates rebooking alternatives (flights, rail, upgrades)
- Explains recommendations with confidence scores and reasoning
- Suggests lounges, restaurants, charging stations, and workspaces
- Displays an airport map, timeline, weather, and agentic workflow
- Provides a conversational AI copilot with OpenAI fallback support

## Features

- **Large Flight Card** — airline, route, gate, boarding time, status, countdown, delay reason
- **Proactive AI Panel** — automatically generated travel insights (delays, connections, lounges, walking times, security queues)
- **AI Copilot Chat** — conversational assistant with quick prompts, typing indicator, and source attribution (OpenAI / JourneyMind)
- **Rebooking Engine** — alternative flights, high-speed rail, next-day options, business upgrades with price, duration, confidence, and recommendation
- **Smart Recommendations** — explains *why* an option is best (lowest delay, cost, reliability, walking distance, transfer risk)
- **Airport Services** — lounges, restaurants, coffee, charging, workspaces, family areas with ratings and distances
- **Journey Timeline** — check-in, security, gate, boarding, departure, arrival, hotel
- **Airport Map Placeholder** — SVG map with current position, gate, lounge, restaurant, and walking path
- **AI Agent Workflow** — simulated autonomous actions: detect, evaluate, contact APIs, update itinerary, generate recommendations, notify
- **Weather & Travel Alerts** — origin/destination weather and unread notifications
- **Dark / Light Mode** — toggle with Tailwind `dark` class
- **Voice Input Mock** — microphone button triggers mock capture and sends a query

## Run Instructions

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/azamasad/journeymind-ai.git
cd journeymind-ai
```

### 2. Backend

```bash
cd backend
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
```

Backend will be available at `http://localhost:8000`.

### 3. Frontend

In a new terminal:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Frontend will be available at `http://localhost:3000` and proxies `/api` calls to the backend.

### Optional: OpenAI Integration

Set the environment variable to use a real OpenAI model:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
```

If no key is provided, JourneyMind AI falls back to intelligent, context-aware mocked responses.
